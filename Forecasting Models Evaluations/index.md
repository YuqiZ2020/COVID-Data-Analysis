### Project Description: 

An increasing amount of COVID-19 forecasting models emerge as the pandemic keep spreading. However, to what degree theses models are reliable and how can we make use of these models remain to be questions. We believe that there are three major factors we need to consider when evaluating these models:
1. Transparency 
2. Reproducibility and 
3. Validity

### Summary: 

1.	MIT works with clarification of parameters from the developers
2.	Auquan and NotreDame-mobility are good to go; NotreDame-mobility might need further clarification
3.	LSHTM might work if we contact the developers
4.	ICL and JHU each has some strange issues
5.	Need to use Mac/Linux to test out CAN and UMass-MB

### Some Multi Model Comparisons:
